passage ='''The Eighty-Six werent buried in graves. 
There could be no graves when there were no casualties. Even collecting their remains was
forbidden. Pigs masquerading as humans were denied the right to rest in
peace, or even the right to mourn their dead comrades.
Therefore, if you were to define someone speaking a different tongue,
someone of a different color, someone of a different heritage as a pig
in human form, any oppression, persecution, or atrocity you might inflict
upon them would never be regarded as cruel or inhumane.
You should know to treat livestock as livestock. You simply cannot get
those barbarian Eighty-Six to understand human ideals and nobility.'''
